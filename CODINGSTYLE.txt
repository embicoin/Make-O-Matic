Python coding styles vary, and are widely discussed. We are asking you
to stick to the following standards:

- Tabs instead of spaces: In a language where indent levels matter, it
  makes sense to use a single character for every indent. Here are some
  configuration options to adhere to our coding style for the PyDev IDE.
  - Uncheck "General/Editors/Text Editors/Insert spaces for tabs".
  - Check "Show whitespace characters" in the same pane. (optional)
  - Uncheck "Pydev/Editor/Replace tabs with spaces when typing".
- Longer lines: Use up to 132 character per line.
- Method and function names
  - Class methods: camelCase with first lower
  - Global functions: lower_with_underscores
  - Configure in "Pydev/Editor/Code Style"
    - Simply use "camelCase()" here, global functions' style cant be configured
- Code formatting
  - Simply check all boxes in "Pydev/Editor/Code Style/Code Formatter".
