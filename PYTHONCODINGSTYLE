Python coding styles vary, and are widely discussed. We are asking you
to stick to the following standards: 

- Tabs instead of spaces: In a language where indent levels matter, it
  makes sense to use a single character for every indent. In Pydev,
  uncheck "General/Editors/Text Editors/Insert spaces for tabs". It
  makes sense to also check "Show whitespace characters" in the same
  pane. Also, uncheck "Pydev/Editor/Replace tabs with spaces when
  typing". 
- Longer lines: Use up to 132 character per line.
- Method and function names: camelCase with first lower
  ("Pydev/Editor/Code Style").
- Code formatter: Simply check all boxes in "Pydev/Editor/Code
  Style/Code Formatter".
